# guilty_by_association
 
This repository contains all the files associated with the paper, "Guilty by Association: How Heterogeneous Are Nationalist Voters?" The paper is one of three articles/chapters from my dissertation. Motivated by a hypothesis that many nationalist voters in rich democracies do not actually have anti-immigration preferences, which has been backed by narrow natural experimental research in political science, I wanted to test the idea using the rich survey on European voters, their attitudes, their sociodemographic, and their socioeconomic characteristics.

As it stands, this paper has not been sent to a journal for review. Even if it could be published in its current state (which is a big if), I want to make revisions that clarify my prose, use a (simple) formal model of voting to showcase my argument, and adjust some specifications of my empirical models. Consequently, the files in this repository are subject to change.

With that caveat, the files are organized as follows. The "external_data" folder contains raw datasets from outside sources; the "internal_data" folder contains cleaned datasets, which are either the product of basic filtering, selecting, renaming, recoding, and merging or of statistical methods like factor analysis and multiple imputation; the "model_objects" folder contains .RData objects of model results I saved; the "plots" folder contains all the plots I generated; and the "rscripts" folder contains all the scripts necessary to replicate my data cleaning, mergining, and modeling. Please feel free to email me with questions you have about any files.

Last, the "final_guilty_by_association.pdf" is a PDF version of the paper.
